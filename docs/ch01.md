## Software

### Software

軟體是什麼？僅是可以執行的程式碼嗎？IEEE  的定義更為廣泛：

> Computer **programs**, **procedures**, and possibly associated **documentation** and **data** pertaining to the operation of a computer system. That is, software is consisted of *code*, *procedure*, *documentation*, *data* necessary for *operating* the software system.

除了程式碼以外，操作的程序、資料、文件是「軟體」的範圍。就像華航事件一般，多少是操作的問題所引起的，所以再考量軟體品質時，不能不把這些考量在內。

> 程式必須是為了給人看而寫，命令機器執行只是附帶任務。

### Application types

* **Stand-alone applications**
These are application systems that run on a local computer, such as a PC. They include all necessary functionality and do not need to be connected to a network. 
* **Interactive transaction-based applications**
Applications that execute on a remote computer and are accessed by users from their own PCs or terminals. These include web applications such as e-commerce applications. 
* **Embedded control systems** 
These are software control systems that control and manage hardware devices. Numerically, there are probably more embedded systems than any other type of system. 
* **Batch processing systems** 
These are business systems that are designed to process data in large batches. They process large numbers of individual inputs to create corresponding outputs. 
* **Entertainment systems** 
These are systems that are primarily for personal use and which are intended to entertain the user. 
* **Systems for modeling and simulation** 
These are systems that are developed by scientists and engineers to model physical processes or situations, which include many, separate, interacting objects. 
* **Data collection systems** 	
These are systems that collect data from their environment using a set of sensors and send that data to other systems for processing.

### General issues that affect software

* **Heterogeneity** 
Increasingly, systems are required to operate as distributed systems across networks that include different types of computer and mobile devices. 
* **Business and social change** 
Business and society are changing incredibly quickly as emerging economies develop and new technologies become available. They need to be able to change their existing software and to rapidly develop new software. 
* **Security and trust**
As software is intertwined with all aspects of our lives, it is essential that we can trust that software. 
* **Scale**
Software has to be developed across a very wide range of scales, from very small embedded systems in portable or wearable devices through to Internet-scale, cloud-based systems that serve a global community. 



## Software Engineering
- [software engineering = coding?](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19va_iKSKUqG3irU58qg3NxQxZ5SqWM8dbC3pETC-xL4/edit#slide=id.p1)


### What is software engineering?

#### What is engineering?

**Engineering** is the science, skill, and profession of acquiring and applying scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge, in order to design and also build structures, machines, devices, systems, materials and processes.

#### Software Engineering
- An engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production.
- Adopt a systematic and organized approach to their work and use appropriate tools and techniques depending on the problem to be solved, the development constraints and the resources available.

### SE activities

* **Software specification**, where customers and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operation.
* **Software development**, where the software is designed and programmed.
* **Software validation**, where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires.
* **Software evolution**, where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements.

## Code of Ethics

ACM/IEEE 軟體工程師職業道德守則（Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice）是由美國電腦學會（Association for Computing Machinery，簡稱 ACM）和 IEEE（Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers）共同制定的一套道德守則，旨在引導軟體工程師在其專業實踐中遵守高標準的道德行為和職業操守。以下是其主要內容：

1. **公眾利益（Public）**：軟體工程師應該考慮到公眾的利益，包括但不限於健康、安全和福祉。他們應該專注於開發安全可靠的軟體產品，並確保這些產品對社會產生積極的影響。
2. **客戶和雇主（Client and Employer）**：軟體工程師應該尊重客戶和雇主的需求，並致力於提供高品質的產品和服務。他們應該遵循專業標準，確保所提供的產品符合客戶的期望，並保護雇主的利益。
3. **產品（Product）**：軟體工程師應該確保所開發的產品具有高質量、高效率和高可靠性。他們應該專注於產品的功能、性能、安全性和可維護性，並確保產品符合相關的法律和法規要求。
4. **判斷（Judgment）**：軟體工程師應該行使良好的判斷力，並在面對倫理和專業問題時做出正確的決策。他們應該尊重他人的意見和觀點，並考慮到各種可能的後果。
5. **管理（Management）**：軟體工程師應該遵循專業的管理原則，並確保團隊成員之間的溝通和合作。他們應該建立良好的工作環境，並確保團隊成員的專業發展和職業滿足。
6. **專業發展（Professional Development）**：軟體工程師應該持續學習和提升自己的專業能力，並遵守相關的專業準則和標準。他們應該參加相關的培訓和教育活動，並不斷改進自己的技能和知識。

總的來說，ACM/IEEE 軟體工程師職業道德守則旨在促進軟體工程師的專業行為和職業操守，並確保他們在其專業實踐中遵守高標準的道德準則。這些準則提供了一個指導框架，幫助軟體工程師在面對各種倫理和專業問題時做出正確的決策。

## FQA of software engineering

**What is software?**
* Computer programs and associated documentation. Software products may be developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general market.

**What are the attributes of good software?**
* Good software should deliver the required functionality and performance to the user and should be maintainable, dependable and usable.

**What is software engineering?**
* Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production.

**What are the fundamental software engineering activities?**
* Software specification, software development, software validation and software evolution.

**What is the difference between software engineering and computer science?**
* Computer science focuses on theory and fundamentals; software engineering is concerned with the practicalities of developing and delivering useful software.

**What is the difference between software engineering and system engineering?**
* System engineering is concerned with all aspects of computer-based systems development including hardware, software and process engineering. Software engineering is part of this more general process.

**What are the key challenges facing software engineering?**
* Coping with increasing diversity, demands for reduced delivery times and developing trustworthy software.

**What are the costs of software engineering?**
* Roughly 60% of software costs are development costs, 40% are testing costs. For custom software, evolution costs often exceed development costs.

**What are the best software engineering techniques and methods?**
* While all software projects have to be professionally managed and developed, different techniques are appropriate for different types of system. For example, games should always be developed using a series of prototypes whereas safety critical control systems require a complete and analyzable specification to be developed. You can’t, therefore, say that one method is better than another.
